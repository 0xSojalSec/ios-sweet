# iOS 16 on sweet (Redmi Note 10 Pro, SM7150) - working notes

## Agent handoff / active work (2026-10-15)
- User wants persistent progress toward iOS 16, commits for completed changes, builds through `gh` / GitHub Actions.
- Keep this file current at every milestone so another agent can resume immediately, including when usage limits interrupt a session.
- Patch 0016 implemented: new `iokit/Kernel/arm/SweetPlatformExpert.cpp`, arm64 source list, built-in personality in KernelConfigTables.cpp guarded by ARM64_BOARD_CONFIG_SWEET. Matches only xiaomi,sweet at score 10000, keeps IOPanicPlatform fallback for other hardware. Uses IODTPlatformExpert base initialization/power domain and createNubs CPU logical-ID annotation; overrides top-level publishing because base requires nonexistent Apple NVRAM /options. Publishes real CPU/top-level nodes, provides bounded target/product names, and registers the platform service. GIC/PMGR and arm-io child-bus drivers remain separate work. Both C++ TUs compile (`research/platform-objs`), all imports resolve against 0015/own objects, all 16 patches apply and sources match. Sandbox `research/bt19/xnu`; originals `research/pre0016`. NEXT: full Actions/QEMU; inspect CPU boot waits after the platform registers, do not equate absence of panic with successful boot.
- Patch 0015 CI `38749549779` PASSED (4m3s), checksum verified. Kernel `xnu/out-0015/kernel.development.sweet`, SHA256 `ca1b424a596c7058550ad1659080a333e7643270f019656401d80bf2b876645f`; buildtree/log `research/bt19` / `research/run19.log`. QEMU `research/q0015` (10s, zero unknown glyphs) passes trust-cache handling and machine lockdown, then panics `Unable to find driver for this platform: "xiaomi,sweet" @IOPlatformExpert.cpp:2319` (IOPanicPlatform fallback). Next concrete work: add a built-in SWEET IODTPlatformExpert personality/class; keep the fallback for mismatched platforms. No phone boot yet.
- Direct trust-cache API checks PASSED in the actual 0015 kernel under QEMU/GDB (`research/check-trustcache.gdb`, `research/check-trustcache.log`, `research/q0015-api`): runtime pointers NULL, hash/UUID queries return NOT_FOUND, typed/untyped/legacy loads return NOT_SUPPORTED, capabilities outputs zero and bounds preserved, invalid-argument cases still reject. Second PRNG check also verifies contended refresh returns immediately (`research/check-prng2.log`, `research/q0014-api2`).
- Patch 0015 committed/pushed `8f851d4`, Actions run `38749549779` running: https://github.com/dipa-studio/ios-sweet/actions/runs/38749549779. Do not duplicate.
- Direct PRNG API checks passed in the REAL 0014 kernel under QEMU/GDB, stopped before trust-cache init (`research/check-prng.gdb`, log `research/check-prng.log`, guest `research/q0014-api`). Invoked read_random for 600 bytes (chunking and buffer sentinel intact), repeated output differed, zero-length read/write succeeded, write_random(64-byte input) succeeded, secondary generator 1 initialized and generated distinct output. QEMU log has no exceptions during these checks; guest was discarded after the tests. This tests API behavior, not a cryptographic certification or SMP scheduling.
- Patch 0015 implemented in `bsd/kern/kern_trustcache.c`: SWEET with missing Image4/AMFI marks both runtime pointers NULL and logs service unavailability. Existing static loader handles NULL. Public load APIs return KERN_NOT_SUPPORTED; hash/UUID queries return KERN_NOT_FOUND; capabilities outputs are zero with KERN_NOT_SUPPORTED. Invalid-input checks remain, and Apple paths/available-provider initialization retain existing behavior. No trust is granted. Local arm64 compile passed (`research/trustcache-objs`), all 15 patches apply and sources match. Sandbox `research/bt18/xnu`, baseline `research/pre0015`. Next: Actions/QEMU and direct unavailable-service API checks using GDB.
- Patch 0014 CI `38748543058` PASSED (4m0s), artifact checksum passed. Kernel `xnu/out-0014/kernel.development.sweet`, SHA256 `741de20c851755d333759d7e668346f3edb4f325efac4cc7c142d80d1f5ff75c`; buildtree/log `research/bt18` / `research/run18.log`. QEMU run `research/q0014` (10s, zero unknown glyphs) prints `SWEET PRNG: HMAC-SHA256 registered`, passes commpage initialization, loads vnguard policy, THEN panics `image4 interface not available @kern_trustcache.c:253`. PC=0 fault FIXED IN QEMU. No new phone boot performed.
- Next work: SWEET currently has neither AppleImage4 nor AMFI. `trust_cache_runtime_init` unconditionally requires both; unlike BCM2837, SWEET enters this startup path. Investigate an explicitly unavailable trust-cache runtime with rejected loads/no query matches while providers are absent; preserve all Apple-platform checks. Merely skipping the startup call would leave later AMFI/IMG4 dereferences unsafe. Existing load_static_trust_cache already handles trust_cache_rt == NULL.
- QEMU runner now supports `--kernel MATCHING_KERNEL --fail-on-panic`: runtime font extraction from the payload produces exact `fb.txt`, plus `result.json`; a visible panic returns 2. Baseline 0013 re-run `research/q0013-text` detects the same NULL callback panic with zero unknown glyphs. Synthetic glyph roundtrip (including literal `?`) and invalid-VA rejection passed. Screen rows remain circular, not a full log; `no_panic_observed` does not prove successful boot. README has the invocation.
- Patch 0014 committed/pushed as `be61f99`; Actions run `38748543058` is running: https://github.com/dipa-studio/ios-sweet/actions/runs/38748543058. Do not start a duplicate build.
- 2026-10-15 active: hardware photo `IMG_20261015_160033.jpg` confirms the same PC=0 instruction-fetch abort as QEMU (LR `0xfffffe0007443fe4` = read_random). Independently reproduced with kernel 0013 in `research/q0013` (8-second run); prior allocator fix works. Latest tooling commit reviewed: `8d66d2d`.
- Patch 0014 implemented: registers a built-in HMAC-SHA256 DRBG provider at EARLY_BOOT/FIRST, before commpage creation. A shared mutex serializes output/reseed across CPUs (correctness first; no per-CPU scaling yet), initgen validates CPU identities, refresh uses try-lock and the existing entropy filter/health tests. SWEET entropy accumulation and write_random now use the built-in SHA256 directly; no incomplete g_crypto_funcs table is registered. The existing bootloader-seed requirement remains enforced.
- Local validation: both PRNG translation units compile to arm64 objects in `research/prng-objs`; no SHA256 wrapper imports remain. All 14 patches apply in CI order and resulting PRNG sources match local inputs. Sandbox `research/bt17/xnu`, originals `research/pre0014`, checker `research/check-patch-order.py`. NEXT: Actions kernel build, download to `xnu/out-0014`, run the QEMU payload before requesting another phone boot. Baseline QEMU ADT/payload are `research/q0013.adt` / `research/q0013.bin`.
- 2026-10-15 08:15 QEMU EMULATION WORKS (`tools/qemu-sweet.py`, see "QEMU emulation" below). Patch 0013 VERIFIED in QEMU: boot passes kmem_crypto_init and ulock_initialize. NEXT BLOCKER (reproduced in QEMU, expected on hardware too): `pmap_create_commpages -> random() -> RandomULong -> read_random -> prng_funcs.refresh == NULL` (instruction fetch abort at pc 0, lr read_random+0x34). Nobody calls `register_and_init_prng` (closed corecrypto kext does it on Apple). Fix = patch 0014: SWEET-registered cckprng_funcs provider (osfmk/prng/prng_random.c); note random_cpu_init also panics while !prng_ready. The 07:26 hardware boot of 0013 will most likely show this same panic.
- Previous hardware boot: patch 0013 (`a3a46e2`) CI `38686345689` PASSED (3m44s), image `shim/out/shim-boot-0013.img` was temporarily booted on 2026-10-15 at 05:26 UTC: send OKAY (0.407s), boot OKAY (0.134s), total 0.546s. Superseded by the hardware/QEMU PC=0 observation and patch 0014 work above.
- Latest kernel implementation commit: `8f851d4`. Latest successful kernel CI: `38749549779` (patch 0015), https://github.com/dipa-studio/ios-sweet/actions/runs/38749549779.
- CURRENT image: `shim/out/shim-boot-0013.img`, 16,412,672 bytes, SHA256 `110d1c46aee4b60253db24b6535e9781c4cf0fd25ca2a70e9016cf81378cea25`. Kernel `xnu/out-0013/kernel.development.sweet`, SHA256 `f0b1d375995316c550ce7014ff234d8271e9b9ac2857795ceff41b76ba2cd740`, plain arm64. CI log confirms 0013 applied; checksums passed. Entry PA `0xb146b488`, kernel end PA `0xb1ff4000`.
- Current log/buildtree: `research/run17.log`, `research/bt17` (extracted, no nested .git; preferred baseline for patch 0014). Payload/ADT: `shim/out/payload-0013.bin`, `shim/out/sweet-0013.adt` (includes /defaults). Unpacked ramdisk byte-compared with payload in `shim/out/check-0013`.
- Patch-0012 original image: `shim/out/shim-boot-0012.img`, 16,412,672 bytes, SHA256 `cf4b8ec4a65a51888d71c17d09cd0831d6b761b90e2531fdb8e575c32f4fd24a`. Kernel `xnu/out-0012/kernel.development.sweet`, SHA256 `69b78f49f6459cc63a0af44e7cf73c1779ef72130ef72b12ae86c88183ffc742`; checksums passed and sweet_early_relocate symbol present. Entry PA remains `0xb146b488`, kernel end PA `0xb1ff4000`.
- Patch-0012 log/tree: `research/run16.log`, `research/bt16` (extracted, no nested .git; preferred baseline for next patch). CI log confirms 0012 applied. Payload `shim/out/payload-0012.bin`, ADT `shim/out/sweet-0012.adt`; packed ramdisk byte-compared with payload in `shim/out/check-0012`.
- Active payload command line: `debug=0xc serial=3 cpus=1 keepsyms=1 -enable_kprintf_spam`.
- Latest observed photo: `/home/dipa/Downloads/IMG_20261015_071346.jpg` (local only). Stages 9 (kernel framebuffer VA), 10 (TTBR0 off/TLB flush), 11 (physmap table pointers) and 12 (calling pmap_bootstrap) all visible. Persistent diagnostics are VERIFIED ON HARDWARE.
- pmap.c:1987 is the assert after SecureDTLookupEntry(NULL, "/defaults", &entry). The pmap-max-asids property itself is optional; an empty /defaults uses XNU's MAX_ASIDS. Do not bypass the assertion or guess an ASID limit.
- Previous payload-only fix image: `shim/out/shim-boot-0012-defaults.img`, SHA256 `3ff61a268853c6ea7cbf284833f1346a1d791980ca366b6e1a215a86e040512b` (16,412,672 bytes). Same kernel/CI as 0012; ADT 2516 bytes (`shim/out/sweet-0012-defaults.adt`), root /defaults present with no ASID override. Payload `shim/out/payload-0012-defaults.bin`; unpacked ramdisk exactly matches payload (`shim/out/check-0012-defaults`). This boot reached the allocator crypto NULL-pointer fault below.
- Latest hardware photo: `/home/dipa/Downloads/IMG_20261015_071608.jpg` (local only). Normal serial framebuffer console works. VM bootstrap/zone initialization, logging, scheduler, IPC, KDP and ulock_initialize print before the kmem_crypto_init data abort. gPanicBase warnings are expected because PLATFORM_PANIC_LOG_DISABLED is configured, and are not the faulting call.
- Faulting instruction: `ldr x0, [x8, #0x150]` in crypto_random_kmem_ctx_size; x8 = NULL g_crypto_funcs. Source: libkern/crypto/corecrypto_rand.c and osfmk/vm/vm_kern.c:2448. rand.h explicitly permits NON-cryptographic kmem RNGs, but requires no locking in generation and context size <=256. Do not substitute read_random here: the global PRNG provider is also unregistered and kmem generation must remain lock-free. early_random may seed contexts during single-CPU bootstrap; it uses the built-in HMAC-SHA256 DRBG with the host-generated ADT seed.
- Patch 0013 keeps the replacement entirely private to vm_kern.c: SplitMix64 state is 8 bytes per CPU/sizeclass, initialized using early_random. Uniform selection uses rejection sampling to avoid modulo bias. Other platforms retain the original corecrypto calls; SWEET's generic crypto APIs/registration remain untouched. Reference: https://prng.di.unimi.it/splitmix64.c (Sebastiano Vigna, public domain).
- Validation: vm_kern.c compiles to arm64 (`research/kmem-rng-objs`, using `research/run16.log` + `research/bt16`). Undefined symbols include early_random and NO crypto_random_* references. All 13 patches apply in CI order and match the checked source. Original saved as `research/vm_kern.pre0013.c`.
- RNG host checks: extracted actual new helper in `research/kmem-rng-check.c`; 16,384 outputs match the author's downloaded reference (`research/splitmix64-reference.c`), 147,456 bounded outputs satisfy their limits (including 1 and UINT64_MAX), and a forced rejection advances correctly. Full kernel crypto services and the registered kernel PRNG provider remain future work; this patch only supplies the allocator RNG contract.
- Patch-0011 artifacts: kernel `xnu/out-0011/kernel.development.sweet`, log `research/run15.log`, extracted buildtree `research/bt15` (no nested .git). CI log confirms patch 0011 applied; artifact checksums passed. Kernel is plain arm64, entry VA `0xfffffe000746b488` -> PA `0xb146b488`, kernel end PA still `0xb1ff4000`.
- Patch-0011 image: 16,412,672 bytes, SHA256 `29ad5cbfc752473de4af2c471a24a8b34f92da4bff5afec65c614b90cd3ad53a`. Kernel SHA256 `8ac3a956894b09f7bd0d890de8c5de38c65513287feb1e1bcd12db8ca772ee5c`. Payload/ADT in `shim/out/payload-0011.bin`, `shim/out/sweet-0011.adt`. Header unpacked/checked in `shim/out/check-0011`.
- First patch-0011 attempt timed out waiting for FASTBOOT; superseded by the successful send/boot recorded above. Do not repeat the boot before the user reports the current screen.
- Patch-0011 photo: `/home/dipa/Downloads/IMG_20261015_070218.jpg` (local only). Visible stages 1-8 and old red shim text; entry PA B146B488, boot args PA B1FF8000 / top B1FFC000. No evidence yet locating execution after stage 8.
- Patch-0012 sandbox: `research/bt15/xnu` (NO nested .git). Proposed permanent debug VA: VM_MIN_KERNEL_ADDRESS + ARM_TT_L2_SIZE, in the reserved gap below gVirtBase and above low globals; map the same PA framebuffer as Normal-NC in the final TTBR1 before arm_vm_physmap_init changes phystokv(). Keep the early panic sink until normal kprintf startup.
- Patch 0012 validation: all 4 changed C translation units compiled to arm64 objects in `research/post-ttbr0-objs`; internal header export added to osfmk/arm64/Makefile and recreated locally in EXPORT_HDRS for pe_serial.c. All 12 patches apply in CI order and match all 6 edited files. Baselines are saved under `research/pre0012/`.
- Actual mapping-helper host model (`research/early-map-check.c`, barrier stubbed only for host compilation) confirms: VA `0xfffffe0002000000`, L1 index 2016, L2 index 1; descriptor `0x006000009c000605` = framebuffer PA, Normal-NC, outer-shareable, EL1 RW, PXN+UXN. All other L2 entries preserved. The gap is excluded by ARM_LARGE_MEMORY's pmap_virtual_region(0).
- Next boot command line MUST add `-enable_kprintf_spam`: DEVELOPMENT disables kprintf_output by default even when DB_KPRT is set (`pexpert/arm/pe_kprintf.c`). Planned command line: `debug=0xc serial=3 cpus=1 keepsyms=1 -enable_kprintf_spam`.

### Patch 0012 screen legend (after original stages 1-8)
- 9: kernel framebuffer VA live; 10: TTBR0 off / TLB flushed; 11: physmap pointers rebound.
- 12: calling pmap_bootstrap; 13: pmap_bootstrap returned; 14: early I/O page tables ready; 15: arm_vm_init returned.
- 16: calling serial_init; 17: fbcon config read / mapping; 18: fbcon mapping returned; 19: serial_init returned; 20: kprintf startup complete.
- Normal serial initialization clears the screen, so earlier stages may disappear before 19. If serial exists, early console disables after 20; otherwise early panic output stays enabled.
- Local source sandbox: `research/bt13/xnu` (git baseline `623b060`, patches 0001-0008 already in baseline; uncommitted export edits correspond to patch 0009). Preserve those edits when producing patch 0010.
- Previous compile log/tree: `research/run13.log`, `research/bt13`; previous kernel: `xnu/out/kernel.development.sweet`. New successful log/tree: `research/run14.log`, `research/bt14`; new kernel: `xnu/out-0010/kernel.development.sweet`.
- Current device access: patch-0012 image was temporarily started from FASTBOOT; no adb connection is expected. Never flash partitions for bring-up; use `fastboot boot` with the shim image.
- Patch `0010` lives in `xnu/patches/0010-sweet-early-framebuffer-debug.patch`. Its exact compiled sources are under `research/bt13/xnu`; generated objects are in `research/early-objs`.
- Local checks passed: all 5 changed/new translation units compiled to arm64 Mach-O objects; new console only imports `_doprnt` and `iso_font` (both exist in the previous kernel). All 10 patches applied to a temporary upstream git index in CI order, and all 7 resulting changed source files matched the local compile inputs.
- Reproduce changed-file compilation: `XNU_CC_OBJDIR="$PWD/research/early-objs" python3 tools/xnu-cc.py research/run13.log research/bt13 arm_init.c arm_vm_init.c kern/debug.c arm64/start.s osfmk/arm64/sweet_early.c --per-file` (create the output directory first). The helper now accepts explicit new source paths absent from the old artifact's Makefiles and rejects empty selections.
- Device command result: `adb reboot bootloader`, then `timeout 30s fastboot boot shim/out/shim-boot-0010.img`: send OKAY (16028 KB), boot OKAY, total 0.541s. This confirms bootloader acceptance only, not XNU progress.
- The successful boot above was on 2026-10-14. On 2026-10-15, `timeout 45s fastboot boot ...` timed out waiting for a device; no image was sent. Boot image SHA256 rechecked and unchanged. No new build is needed to repeat the trial.
- Earlier retry: `timeout 90s fastboot boot shim/out/shim-boot-0010.img` timed out (exit 124). This is superseded by the successful 2026-10-15 repeat boot recorded above; do not repeat it until the user reports the screen.
- User observation confirms MMU-on C entry, platform expert, CPU topology/bootstrap, startup bootstrap and cpu_init all complete. Failure is within arm_vm_physmap_init (non-XNU_MONITOR branch), before stage 8 / TTBR0 teardown. Old red shim text remains behind the early console; this is expected because only written rows are cleared.
- New edit/compile sandbox is `research/bt14/xnu` (extracted artifact, NO nested .git; `git diff` there would act on the parent project). Use a saved baseline file / generated unified diff, or explicitly initialize a local baseline before editing. `research/bt13/xnu` does have its own baseline git repo.
- Exact user-reported panic: `arm_vm_init.c:1606 Assertion failed: (temp_ptov_table[ptov_index - 1].va + temp_ptov_table[ptov_index - 1].len) <= physmap_end`.
- Root cause: MacOSX build sets `ARM_LARGE_MEMORY=1`; `XNU_MONITOR` is off. Block alignment in arm_vm_physmap_slide can add gaps, but the non-PPL large-memory physmap_end omitted the padding already present in the small-memory branch. Patch 0011 reserves PTOV_TABLE_SIZE*ARM_TT_TWIG_SIZE (8*32MB) in both the aperture bound and its L1 allocation; monitor/PPL builds retain zero padding. The assertion is preserved.
- Validation: `arm_vm_init.c` compiled to an arm64 object using `research/run14.log` + `research/bt14` (object in `research/physmap-objs`). All 11 patches apply in CI order and produce exactly that source. Host harness `research/physmap-check.c` extracts the real XNU slide function with page-table-write stubs: all 65,536 page-aligned slides within 1GB checked against the current kernel memory layout; old bound fails 65,504 cases, padded bound fails zero; worst overrun 0x1ffc000 bytes. Baseline source saved as `research/arm_vm_init.pre0011.c`.
- CI: https://github.com/dipa-studio/ios-sweet/actions/runs/38638702083 (success; artifacts and full log downloaded).
- New image: `shim/out/shim-boot-0010.img` (16,412,672 bytes, SHA256 `ed2c270e0081bad5ff517be415f9bfe8805463aea7866732203fa97ac737e64e`). Previous image preserved as `shim/out/shim-boot-pre0010.img`.
- New kernel SHA256: `3ee05270cc291c49589a101678f904b1b69cb2f2575e05398bce8a4e052f409a`. Artifact checksums passed; arm64 (not arm64e), early-console symbols present. Payload entry VA `0xfffffe000746a488` -> PA `0xb146a488`; kernel end PA `0xb1ff4000`. Command line remains `debug=0xc serial=3 cpus=1 keepsyms=1`.

### Patch 0010 screen legend
- Bottom-left white 64x32 tile: assembly entered `start_first_cpu`, before page tables/MMU.
- Text `SWEET EARLY 1`: entered `arm_init` with MMU on; 2: platform expert done; 3: CPU topology done; 4: CPU bootstrap done; 5: startup bootstrap done; 6: CPU init done; 7: entering `arm_vm_init`; 8: leaving bootstrap TTBR0.
- `SWEET EARLY PANIC:` prints a copy of panic arguments before normal panic handling needs per-CPU/thread state.
- In patches 0010/0011 the console disabled before TTBR0 invalidation; patch 0012 replaces that with a persistent kernel VA alias and diagnostics through normal serial/kprintf startup (see its legend above).
- Screen contents require a physical observation from the user: adb cannot capture a framebuffer after Android has been replaced by a bare-metal kernel.

## QEMU emulation (2026-10-15)
- `tools/mkadt.py OUT.adt --qemu` = same ADT with QEMU virt GICD 0x08000000 / GICR 0x080a0000 / CNTFRQ 62.5 MHz.
- `tools/qemu-sweet.py PAYLOAD OUTDIR [--secs N] [--hmp "x /8gx ADDR"] [--gdb]`: host-side copy of shim/loader.c
  (segments + ADT + boot_args at their PAs, 6-instruction stub sets x0 and jumps), `-M virt,gic-version=3 -cpu cortex-a76`
  (same ID_AA64MMFR0 as Kryo 470), 4G RAM so 0x9c000000 fb and 0xb0000000 kernel are plain RAM.
  Outputs `fb.png` (the screen), `regs.txt`, `qemu.log` (exceptions with ESR/FAR/ELR). `--gdb` halts with a stub on :1234
  (system `gdb` + `set architecture aarch64`, `hbreak *VA` works with the MMU on).
- Not emulated: Qualcomm XPUs, ABL, real panel, PSCI conduit (QEMU virt uses hvc). Hardware still decides those.
- Example: `python3 tools/mkadt.py /tmp/q.adt --qemu && python3 tools/mkpayload.py xnu/out-0013/kernel.development.sweet /tmp/q.adt /tmp/pq.bin --cmdline 'debug=0xc serial=3 cpus=1 keepsyms=1 -enable_kprintf_spam' && python3 tools/qemu-sweet.py /tmp/pq.bin /tmp/q`

## Layout
- `backup/`  partition dumps + full sdb..sdf LUNs, `SHA256SUMS` (all verified on-device == local)
- `dtb/`     live FDT (from OrangeFox), PixelOS boot.img dtb, dtbo, dts versions
- `shim/`    bare-metal boot shim (`./build.sh` -> `out/shim-boot.img`)
- `research/` mainline sm7150 dts, XNU pe_fiq.c etc, PocketDarwin patches
- `tools/unpack_bootv2.py`

## Device access
- No root in PixelOS 17 (user build, adb root disabled). Root = `fastboot boot recovery/recovery.img` (OrangeFox R12.0_2, temp boot, not flashed).
- `fastboot boot` works for stock boot.img, OrangeFox, and our shim.
- Shim resets itself via PSCI SYSTEM_RESET; IMEM restart_reason 0x77665500 is seen
  (bootreason=bootloader) but ABL still boots Android, so it does not stop in fastboot.

## Hardware facts (live DT + shim measurements)
- Framebuffer (ABL cont splash): 0x9c000000, 1080x2400, stride 4320, a8r8g8b8, panel is DSC *video* mode (no kick needed).
- RAM: 0x80000000+2G, 0x100000000+0xfcc00000. Live reserved-memory = PixelOS base dtb + sweet dtbo fixups.
- GICv3: GICD 0x17a00000, GICR 0x17a60000 (stride 0x20000, 8 PEs). GICD_TYPER 0x007B041D: SecurityExtn=1 (DS=0).
  ABL leaves GICD_CTLR = 0x10 (ARE_NS on, groups off). Writing 0x13 reads back 0x12: EnableGrp1A (bit1) is the one that matters.
- GIC Group 1 VERIFIED (shim 2c): vtimer INTID 19 = 30 IRQs/300ms, ptimer INTID 18 = 30, SGI 1 to self = 10/10.
  ICC_SRE=1 already, ICC_CTLR 0x8440, priority/enable writes stick. GICR_IGROUPR0 and GICD_IGROUPRn read 0 from NS
  even though Group 1 delivery works (RAZ in NS view) - do not use them as a health check.
  INTID 28 shows pending constantly (unknown PPI 12).
- Timer 19.2 MHz. Qualcomm PPI numbering: secure-phys/phys/virt/hyp = PPI 1/2/3/0 -> vtimer INTID 19, ptimer 18 (NOT 27/30).
- PSCI 1.1 via SMC, SMCCC 1.1. CPU_ON ok; SYSTEM_SUSPEND and SYSTEM_RESET2 unsupported.
- SMP: CPU_ON works for all 7 secondaries (MPIDR 0x81000n00).
- Entry EL1, MMU off, x0 = DTB (magic ok). ID_AA64MMFR0 = ...101122: 16K granule YES, 4K YES.
- No serial console: debug UART SE is in SPI mode on sweet. Screen is the only debug channel.

## XNU implications
- XNU GICv3 path (pexpert/arm/pe_fiq.c, VMAPPLE) puts the timer (PPI 27) in Group 0 = FIQ. With SecurityExtn=1,
  Group 0 is secure -> impossible from NS EL1. Need: Group 1 IRQ, ICC_IGRPEN1, INTID 19, and the timer handled in the IRQ path.
- XNU VMAPPLE PSCI uses `hvc`; sweet needs `smc`.
- PocketDarwin NonAppleGenericCpu.patch only swaps -mcpu=apple-h7 for -march=armv8-a.

## Milestone 3 (2026-10-14): 16K MMU verified
- ABL loads the Image at 0x80080000 (base 0x80000000 + 0x80000) regardless of text_offset=0.
- 16K granule, T0SZ=28 (L2 start, 32MB blocks), MAIR 0x44ff00, TCR 0x1409CB51C, PARange=2 (40-bit PA).
- Only own image pages WB (Qualcomm XPUs: never map carve-outs cacheable); fb Normal-NC; rest Device.
- AT S1E1R checks all as expected; unmapped -> translation fault L2.
- Fill fb: 110 ms (MMU off) -> 3.5 ms (NC). Memory loop 70 ms -> 0.7 ms. vtimer + SGI IRQs still fine with MMU on.

## XNU loader design notes (xnu-8796)
- Entry: `_start` -> `start_first_cpu`, x0 = boot_args (PA), MMU off, EL1. boot_args: Revision/Version 2,
  virtBase/physBase/memSize/topOfKernelData, Boot_Video (fb 0x9c000000, rowBytes 4320, 1080x2400, depth 32),
  deviceTreeP/Length (ADT), CommandLine[608], bootFlags, memSizeActual.
- start.s maps [kernel mach header .. physBase+memSize) with cacheable BLOCKS. On Qualcomm every XPU carve-out
  must therefore lie below the kernel: use physBase = 0xb0000000 (above ramdump_fb 0xaf000000+16M,
  cdsp_sec, qseecom), end before rmtfs 0xfde01000 -> memSize ~0x4d000000 for bring-up.
- Base ADT: iPhone 8 d20ap DeviceTree from iOS 16.7.16 IPSW (tools/remotezip.py + tools/adt.py; LZFSE payload).
  Template values are empty: the loader must fill chosen/*, memory-map, cpu*/reg etc. like iBoot.
- XNU build: GitHub Actions (dipa-studio/ios-sweet, xnu.yml) via blacktop/darwin-xnu-build, MACOS_VERSION=13.5.
  New-clang fixes in xnu/patches; Xcode 16 iig is incompatible (IORPC.kernelContent) -> macos-14 runner, oldest Xcode.

## Kernel architecture plan (SWEET machine config)
- First stock build (VMAPPLE) is arm64e (PAC). Kryo 470 = ARMv8.2, no PAC -> SWEET must build plain arm64
  (HAS_APPLE_PAC is only defined for __arm64e__, so arm64 drops PAC automatically).
- Template: VMAPPLE (16K pages, GICv3 code in pe_fiq.c) minus APPLEVIRTUALPLATFORM hypercalls/paravirt PAC,
  plus BCM2837 (generic ARM: no APPLE_ARM64_ARCH_FAMILY Apple sysregs). Do not link the KDK lib<cfg>.os.*.a.
- Timer: XNU expects it on FIQ (sleh_fiq -> rtclock_intr). SWEET: GIC Group 1, so sleh_irq must ack ICC_IAR1,
  route INTID 19 to the same timer path, SGIs to cpu_signal_handler, EOI via ICC_EOIR1.
- SMP/interrupts: open-source AppleARMSMP (USE_APPLEARMSMP) needs an IOInterruptController (AIC role) and an
  IOPMGR (CPU power -> PSCI CPU_ON via SMC). Plan: built-in IOKit classes (SweetGIC, SweetPMGR, platform
  expert) compiled into the kernel and matched via iokit/KernelConfigTables.cpp -> no closed kexts needed.
- Debug: xnu patch 0003 sweet-fbcon = kprintf drawn on the framebuffer (ADT node "sweet-fbcon").
- ADT /arm-io ranges must not map to parent 0 (pe_arm_get_soc_base_phys()==0 disables serial): use parent 0x1000000.

## Status 2026-10-14 late: first XNU boot attempt
- SWEET kernel builds (CI run 38635343732, patches 0001-0009). Verified offline: arm64, no PAC, no >v8.2 code,
  70300 classic relocs all in range (slide 0 = no loader work), entry = __start.
- Boot: shim loader worked (initrd 0x846F0000-0x855FE3E0, BOOTARG 0xB1FF8000, JUMP 0xB146A488) but screen stayed
  red -> xnu died/hung before serial_init (fbcon). kprintf is a no-op before STARTUP_SUB_KPRINTF.
- Historical next-step plan (patch 0010, now implemented and built; see active handoff above): early fb debug channel
  1. start.s start_first_cpu (after mov x20,x0 / mov x21,#0): PA marker band (MMU off, direct store to 0x9c000000).
  2. start.s after both create_bootstrap_mapping calls: add ONE block entry to the existing V=P L2 table
     (x25 + 2*PGBYTES; do NOT call create_bootstrap_mapping again: fb and RAM share L1 entry 0, it would replace
     the L2 table). Entry = TYPE_BLOCK|VALID|SH(OUTER)|ATTRINDX(CACHE_ATTRINDX_WRITECOMB=1)|AF|PNX|NX|0x9c000000,
     index = (va & ARM_TT_L2_INDEX_MASK) >> ARM_TT_L2_SHIFT.
  3. new osfmk/arm64/sweet_early.c (+files.arm64 entry): sweet_early_mark(n) colored bands at screen bottom and
     sweet_early_putc using iso_font via VA=PA while the bootstrap TTBR0 is live; disable before
     arm_vm_init's set_mmu_ttb(invalid_ttep) (arm_vm_init.c:2148).
  4. markers in arm_init after PE_init_platform, ml_parse_cpu_topology, cpu_bootstrap, kernel_startup_bootstrap,
     cpu_init, before arm_vm_init.
  5. panic hook at top of panic_trap_to_debugger: va_copy + _doprnt(fmt, &copy, sweet_early_putc, 16).
  Verify with tools/xnu-cc.py (compile+symbols) and patch-order simulation before the single CI run.
